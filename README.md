Sadly due to some personal circumstances i found myself unable to present a final and polished version of this submission.
The code is still missing some important prts tht i wnted to implement such as:
- display for player's and pc's battle grids
- pc's AI 
- player's ships deplyment (so the pc can target them)
- i will also have to add some OOP elements/restructure the while code around classes/objects in order to clear the submission criterias
- will do my best to achieve those results by my next resubmission
